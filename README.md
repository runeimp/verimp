VerImp
======

SemVer tool written in BASH.

This is not terribly usefull just yet. I only have it up on GitHub for tracking development. Do not use this script. I don't even recommend reviewing it for code samples at the moment. It's kinda ugly in there.  O:-)

This tool uses [BATS](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats) for testing itself.
